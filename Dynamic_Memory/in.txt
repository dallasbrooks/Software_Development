Great moments are born from great opportunity.
And that's what you have here tonight, boys.
That's what you have earned here, tonight. One Game.
If we played them ten times they might win nine.
But not this game. Not tonight.
Tonight, we skate with them.
Tonight, we stay with them, and we shut them down because we can.
Tonight, we are the greatest hockey team in the world.
You were born to be hockey players. Everyone of you.
This is your time.
Their time is done. It's over.
I'm sick and tired of hearing about what a great hockey team the Soviets have.
Screw them. This is your time.
Now go out there and take it.
